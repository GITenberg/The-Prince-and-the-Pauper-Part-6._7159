<p>Chapter XVIII. The Prince with the tramps.</p>

<p>The troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward on their
march. &nbsp;There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy ground under foot, and
a winter chill in the air. &nbsp;All gaiety was gone from the company; some
were sullen and silent, some were irritable and petulant, none were
gentle-humoured, all were thirsty.</p>

<p>The Ruffler put 'Jack' in Hugo's charge, with some brief instructions,
and commanded John Canty to keep away from him and let him alone; he also
warned Hugo not to be too rough with the lad.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>After a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted somewhat.
The troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to improve. &nbsp;They
grew more and more cheerful, and finally began to chaff each other and
insult passengers along the highway. &nbsp;This showed that they were awaking
to an appreciation of life and its joys once more. &nbsp;The dread in which
their sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them the
road, and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing to talk
back. They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full view of
the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful that they did
not take the hedges, too.</p>

<p>By-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home
while the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to
furnish a breakfast for them. &nbsp;They chucked the housewife and her
daughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands, and
made coarse jests about them, accompanied with insulting epithets and
bursts of horse-laughter. &nbsp;They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer
and his sons, kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously
when a good hit was made. They ended by buttering the head of one of the
daughters who resented some of their familiarities. &nbsp;When they took their
leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the heads of
the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the
authorities.</p>

<p>About noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a halt behind
a hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village. &nbsp;An hour was allowed
for rest, then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village
at different points to ply their various trades&mdash;'Jack' was sent with
Hugo. &nbsp;They wandered hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching for
opportunities to do a stroke of business, but finding none&mdash;so he finally
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see nought to steal; it is a paltry place. &nbsp;Wherefore we will beg."</p>

<p>"WE, forsooth! &nbsp;Follow thy trade&mdash;it befits thee. &nbsp;But _I_ will not beg."</p>

<p>"Thou'lt not beg!" exclaimed Hugo, eyeing the King with surprise.
"Prithee, since when hast thou reformed?"</p>

<p>"What dost thou mean?"</p>

<p>"Mean? &nbsp;Hast thou not begged the streets of London all thy life?"</p>

<p>"I? &nbsp;Thou idiot!"</p>

<p>"Spare thy compliments&mdash;thy stock will last the longer. &nbsp;Thy father says
thou hast begged all thy days. &nbsp;Mayhap he lied. Peradventure you will
even make so bold as to SAY he lied," scoffed Hugo.</p>

<p>"Him YOU call my father? &nbsp;Yes, he lied."</p>

<p>"Come, play not thy merry game of madman so far, mate; use it for thy
amusement, not thy hurt. &nbsp;An' I tell him this, he will scorch thee finely
for it."</p>

<p>"Save thyself the trouble. &nbsp;I will tell him."</p>

<p>"I like thy spirit, I do in truth; but I do not admire thy judgment.
Bone-rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life, without going out
of one's way to invite them. &nbsp;But a truce to these matters; _I_ believe
your father. &nbsp;I doubt not he can lie; I doubt not he DOTH lie, upon
occasion, for the best of us do that; but there is no occasion here. &nbsp;A
wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for nought. &nbsp;But
come; sith it is thy humour to give over begging, wherewithal shall we
busy ourselves? &nbsp;With robbing kitchens?"</p>

<p>The King said, impatiently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have done with this folly&mdash;you weary me!"</p>

<p>Hugo replied, with temper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it. But I
will tell you what you WILL do. &nbsp;You will play decoy whilst _I_ beg.
Refuse, an' you think you may venture!"</p>

<p>The King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said, interrupting&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peace! &nbsp;Here comes one with a kindly face. &nbsp;Now will I fall down in a
fit. &nbsp;When the stranger runs to me, set you up a wail, and fall upon your
knees, seeming to weep; then cry out as all the devils of misery were in
your belly, and say, 'Oh, sir, it is my poor afflicted brother, and we be
friendless; o' God's name cast through your merciful eyes one pitiful
look upon a sick, forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow one little
penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready to
perish!'&mdash;and mind you, keep you ON wailing, and abate not till we bilk him of his
penny, else shall you rue it."</p>

<p>Then immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his eyes, and
reel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at hand, down he
sprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to writhe and wallow in the
dirt, in seeming agony.</p>

<p>"O, dear, O dear!" cried the benevolent stranger, "O poor soul, poor
soul, how he doth suffer! &nbsp;There&mdash;let me help thee up."</p>

<p>"O noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely gentleman&mdash;but it
giveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so. &nbsp;My brother there
will tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be
upon me. &nbsp;A penny, dear sir, a penny, to buy a little food; then leave me
to my sorrows."</p>

<p>"A penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature"&mdash;and he fumbled
in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out. "There, poor lad, take
them and most welcome. &nbsp;Now come hither, my boy, and help me carry thy
stricken brother to yon house, where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not his brother," said the King, interrupting.</p>

<p>"What! not his brother?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hear him!" groaned Hugo, then privately ground his teeth. "He denies
his own brother&mdash;and he with one foot in the grave!"</p>

<p>"Boy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy brother. &nbsp;For
shame!&mdash;and he scarce able to move hand or foot. &nbsp;If he is not thy brother, who
is he, then?"</p>

<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>"A beggar and a thief! &nbsp;He has got your money and has picked your pocket
likewise. &nbsp;An' thou would'st do a healing miracle, lay thy staff over his
shoulders and trust Providence for the rest."</p>

<p>But Hugo did not tarry for the miracle. &nbsp;In a moment he was up and off
like the wind, the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry
lustily as he went. &nbsp;The King, breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for his
own release, fled in the opposite direction, and did not slacken his pace
until he was out of harm's reach. &nbsp;He took the first road that offered,
and soon put the village behind him. &nbsp;He hurried along, as briskly as he
could, during several hours, keeping a nervous watch over his shoulder
for pursuit; but his fears left him at last, and a grateful sense of
security took their place. &nbsp;He recognised, now, that he was hungry, and
also very tired. &nbsp;So he halted at a farmhouse; but when he was about to
speak, he was cut short and driven rudely away. &nbsp;His clothes were against
him.</p>

<p>He wandered on, wounded and indignant, and was resolved to put himself in
the way of like treatment no more. &nbsp;But hunger is pride's master; so, as
the evening drew near, he made an attempt at another farmhouse; but here
he fared worse than before; for he was called hard names and was promised
arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly.</p>

<p>The night came on, chilly and overcast; and still the footsore monarch
laboured slowly on. &nbsp;He was obliged to keep moving, for every time he sat
down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold. &nbsp;All his
sensations and experiences, as he moved through the solemn gloom and the
empty vastness of the night, were new and strange to him. &nbsp;At intervals
he heard voices approach, pass by, and fade into silence; and as he saw
nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of formless
drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about it all that
made him shudder. &nbsp;Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a light&mdash;always
far away, apparently&mdash;almost in another world; if he heard the tinkle of
a sheep's bell, it was vague, distant, indistinct; the muffled lowing of
the herds floated to him on the night wind in vanishing cadences, a
mournful sound; now and then came the complaining howl of a dog over
viewless expanses of field and forest; all sounds were remote; they made
the little King feel that all life and activity were far removed from
him, and that he stood solitary, companionless, in the centre of a
measureless solitude.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="18-230"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="18-230.jpg (152K)" src="images/18-230.jpg" height="848" width="697">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>He stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new
experience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves
overhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and by-and-by he
came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand. &nbsp;He
stepped back into the shadows and waited. &nbsp;The lantern stood by the open
door of a barn. &nbsp;The King waited some time&mdash;there was no sound, and
nobody stirring. &nbsp;He got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable barn
looked so enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and
enter. He started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing the
threshold he heard voices behind him. &nbsp;He darted behind a cask, within
the barn, and stooped down. &nbsp;Two farm-labourers came in, bringing the
lantern with them, and fell to work, talking meanwhile. &nbsp;Whilst they
moved about with the light, the King made good use of his eyes and took
the bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end
of the place, purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to
himself. &nbsp;He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway
of the route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the
crown of England for one night.</p>

<p>By-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door behind them
and taking the lantern with them. &nbsp;The shivering King made for the
blankets, with as good speed as the darkness would allow; gathered them
up, and then groped his way safely to the stall. &nbsp;Of two of the blankets
he made a bed, then covered himself with the remaining two. &nbsp;He was a
glad monarch, now, though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite
warm enough; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost
suffocatingly powerful.</p>

<p>Although the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired and so
drowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage of
the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of
semi-consciousness. &nbsp;Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself
wholly, he distinctly felt something touch him! &nbsp;He was broad awake in a
moment, and gasping for breath. &nbsp;The cold horror of that mysterious touch
in the dark almost made his heart stand still. &nbsp;He lay motionless, and
listened, scarcely breathing. But nothing stirred, and there was no
sound. &nbsp;He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long time,
but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound. &nbsp;So he began to drop
into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once he felt that mysterious
touch again! &nbsp;It was a grisly thing, this light touch from this noiseless
and invisible presence; it made the boy sick with ghostly fears. &nbsp;What
should he do? &nbsp;That was the question; but he did not know how to answer
it. &nbsp;Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters and fly from
this inscrutable horror? &nbsp;But fly whither? &nbsp;He could not get out of the
barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and thither in the dark,
within the captivity of the four walls, with this phantom gliding after
him, and visiting him with that soft hideous touch upon cheek or shoulder
at every turn, was intolerable. &nbsp;But to stay where he was, and endure
this living death all night&mdash;was that better? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;What, then, was there
left to do? &nbsp;Ah, there was but one course; he knew it well&mdash;he must put
out his hand and find that thing!</p>

<p>It was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up to try it.
Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark,
gingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp&mdash;not because it had
encountered anything, but because he had felt so sure it was just GOING
to. &nbsp;But the fourth time, he groped a little further, and his hand
lightly swept against something soft and warm. &nbsp;This petrified him,
nearly, with fright; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine
the thing to be nothing else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm.
He thought he would rather die than touch it again. &nbsp;But he thought this
false thought because he did not know the immortal strength of human
curiosity. In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping
again&mdash;against his judgment, and without his consent&mdash;but groping persistently
on, just the same. &nbsp;It encountered a bunch of long hair; he shuddered,
but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm rope;
followed up the rope and found an innocent calf!&mdash;for the rope was not a
rope at all, but the calf's tail.</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>The King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that
fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf; but he
need not have felt so about it, for it was not the calf that frightened
him, but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for; and
any other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and
suffered just as he had done.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="18-233"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="18-233.jpg (109K)" src="images/18-233.jpg" height="575" width="708">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>The King was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a
calf, but delighted to have the calf's company; for he had been feeling
so lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even this
humble animal were welcome. &nbsp;And he had been so buffeted, so rudely
entreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel that
he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at least a
soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes might be
lacking. &nbsp;So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with the calf.</p>

<p>While stroking its sleek warm back&mdash;for it lay near him and within easy
reach&mdash;it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways
than one. &nbsp;Whereupon he re-arranged his bed, spreading it down close to
the calf; then he cuddled himself up to the calf's back, drew the covers
up over himself and his friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and
comfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace
of Westminster.</p>

<p>Pleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller seeming. &nbsp;He
was free of the bonds of servitude and crime, free of the companionship
of base and brutal outlaws; he was warm; he was sheltered; in a word, he
was happy. &nbsp;The night wind was rising; it swept by in fitful gusts that
made the old barn quake and rattle, then its forces died down at
intervals, and went moaning and wailing around corners and
projections&mdash;but it was all music to the King, now that he was snug and comfortable:
let it blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan and wail, he
minded it not, he only enjoyed it. &nbsp;He merely snuggled the closer to his
friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted blissfully out of
consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that was full of serenity
and peace. &nbsp;The distant dogs howled, the melancholy kine complained, and
the winds went on raging, whilst furious sheets of rain drove along the
roof; but the Majesty of England slept on, undisturbed, and the calf did
the same, it being a simple creature, and not easily troubled by storms
or embarrassed by sleeping with a king.</p>

<p>Chapter XIX. The Prince with the peasants.</p>

<p>When the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet but
thoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy
bed for itself in his bosom. &nbsp;Being disturbed now, it scampered away.
The boy smiled, and said, "Poor fool, why so fearful? &nbsp;I am as forlorn as
thou. &nbsp;'Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so
helpless. &nbsp;Moreover, I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king
has fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely
meaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no
lower go."</p>

<p>He got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard the sound
of children's voices. &nbsp;The barn door opened and a couple of little girls
came in. &nbsp;As soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased, and
they stopped and stood still, gazing at him with strong curiosity; they
presently began to whisper together, then they approached nearer, and
stopped again to gaze and whisper. &nbsp;By-and-by they gathered courage and
began to discuss him aloud. &nbsp;One said&mdash;</p>

<p>"He hath a comely face."</p>

<p>The other added&mdash;</p>

<p>"And pretty hair."</p>

<p>"But is ill clothed enow."</p>

<p>"And how starved he looketh."</p>

<p>They came still nearer, sidling shyly around and about him, examining him
minutely from all points, as if he were some strange new kind of animal,
but warily and watchfully the while, as if they half feared he might be a
sort of animal that would bite, upon occasion. &nbsp;Finally they halted
before him, holding each other's hands for protection, and took a good
satisfying stare with their innocent eyes; then one of them plucked up
all her courage and inquired with honest directness&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who art thou, boy?"</p>

<p>"I am the King," was the grave answer.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>The children gave a little start, and their eyes spread themselves wide
open and remained so during a speechless half minute. &nbsp;Then curiosity
broke the silence&mdash;</p>

<p>"The KING? &nbsp;What King?"</p>

<p>"The King of England."</p>

<p>The children looked at each other&mdash;then at him&mdash;then at each other
again&mdash;wonderingly, perplexedly; then one said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Didst hear him, Margery?&mdash;he said he is the King. &nbsp;Can that be true?"</p>

<p>"How can it be else but true, Prissy? &nbsp;Would he say a lie? &nbsp;For look you,
Prissy, an' it were not true, it WOULD be a lie. &nbsp;It surely would be.
Now think on't. &nbsp;For all things that be not true, be lies&mdash;thou canst
make nought else out of it."</p>

<p>It was a good tight argument, without a leak in it anywhere; and it left
Prissy's half-doubts not a leg to stand on. &nbsp;She considered a moment,
then put the King upon his honour with the simple remark&mdash;</p>

<p>"If thou art truly the King, then I believe thee."</p>

<p>"I am truly the King."</p>

<p>This settled the matter. &nbsp;His Majesty's royalty was accepted without
further question or discussion, and the two little girls began at once to
inquire into how he came to be where he was, and how he came to be so
unroyally clad, and whither he was bound, and all about his affairs. &nbsp;It
was a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not
be scoffed at or doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting
even his hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and
tenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids. &nbsp;But when he got down to
his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without
food, they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a
breakfast for him.</p>

<p>The King was cheerful and happy now, and said to himself, "When I am come
to mine own again, I will always honour little children, remembering how
that these trusted me and believed in me in my time of trouble; whilst
they that were older, and thought themselves wiser, mocked at me and held
me for a liar."</p>

<p>The children's mother received the King kindly, and was full of pity; for
his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her womanly
heart. &nbsp;She was a widow, and rather poor; consequently she had seen
trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate. &nbsp;She imagined
that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or keepers; so
she tried to find out whence he had come, in order that she might take
measures to return him; but all her references to neighbouring towns and
villages, and all her inquiries in the same line went for nothing&mdash;the
boy's face, and his answers, too, showed that the things she was talking
of were not familiar to him. &nbsp;He spoke earnestly and simply about court
matters, and broke down, more than once, when speaking of the late King
'his father'; but whenever the conversation changed to baser topics, he
lost interest and became silent.</p>

<p>The woman was mightily puzzled; but she did not give up. &nbsp;As she
proceeded with her cooking, she set herself to contriving devices to
surprise the boy into betraying his real secret. &nbsp;She talked about
cattle&mdash;he showed no concern; then about sheep&mdash;the same result: &nbsp;so her
guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error; she talked about
mills; and about weavers, tinkers, smiths, trades and tradesmen of all
sorts; and about Bedlam, and jails, and charitable retreats: &nbsp;but no
matter, she was baffled at all points. &nbsp;Not altogether, either; for she
argued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service. &nbsp;Yes,
she was sure she was on the right track, now; he must have been a house
servant. &nbsp;So she led up to that. &nbsp;But the result was discouraging. The
subject of sweeping appeared to weary him; fire-building failed to stir
him; scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm. The goodwife touched,
with a perishing hope, and rather as a matter of form, upon the subject
of cooking. &nbsp;To her surprise, and her vast delight, the King's face
lighted at once! &nbsp;Ah, she had hunted him down at last, she thought; and
she was right proud, too, of the devious shrewdness and tact which had
accomplished it.</p>

<p>Her tired tongue got a chance to rest, now; for the King's, inspired by
gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering pots
and pans, turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an eloquent
dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes, that within three minutes the
woman said to herself, "Of a truth I was right&mdash;he hath holpen in a
kitchen!" &nbsp;Then he broadened his bill of fare, and discussed it with such
appreciation and animation, that the goodwife said to herself, "Good
lack! how can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones withal? &nbsp;For these
belong only upon the tables of the rich and great. &nbsp;Ah, now I see! ragged
outcast as he is, he must have served in the palace before his reason
went astray; yes, he must have helped in the very kitchen of the King
himself! &nbsp;I will test him."</p>

<p>Full of eagerness to prove her sagacity, she told the King to mind the
cooking a moment&mdash;hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or
two, if he chose; then she went out of the room and gave her children a
sign to follow after. &nbsp;The King muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Another English king had a commission like to this, in a bygone time&mdash;it
is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the great
Alfred stooped to assume. &nbsp;But I will try to better serve my trust than
he; for he let the cakes burn."</p>

<p>The intent was good, but the performance was not answerable to it, for
this King, like the other one, soon fell into deep thinkings concerning
his vast affairs, and the same calamity resulted&mdash;the cookery got burned.
The woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire destruction;
and she promptly brought the King out of his dreams with a brisk and
cordial tongue-lashing. Then, seeing how troubled he was over his
violated trust, she softened at once, and was all goodness and gentleness
toward him.</p>

<p>The boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and was greatly refreshed and
gladdened by it. &nbsp;It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious
feature, that rank was waived on both sides; yet neither recipient of the
favour was aware that it had been extended. &nbsp;The goodwife had intended to
feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner, like any other
tramp or like a dog; but she was so remorseful for the scolding she had
given him, that she did what she could to atone for it by allowing him to
sit at the family table and eat with his betters, on ostensible terms of
equality with them; and the King, on his side, was so remorseful for
having broken his trust, after the family had been so kind to him, that
he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself to the family
level, instead of requiring the woman and her children to stand and wait
upon him, while he occupied their table in the solitary state due to his
birth and dignity. &nbsp;It does us all good to unbend sometimes. &nbsp;This good
woman was made happy all the day long by the applauses which she got out
of herself for her magnanimous condescension to a tramp; and the King was
just as self-complacent over his gracious humility toward a humble
peasant woman.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up the
dishes. &nbsp;This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and the King came
near rebelling; but then he said to himself, "Alfred the Great watched
the cakes; doubtless he would have washed the dishes too&mdash;therefore will
I essay it."</p>

<p>He made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too, for the
cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do.
It was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it at
last. &nbsp;He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now; however,
he was not to lose this thrifty dame's society so easily. &nbsp;She furnished
him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got through with
after a fair fashion and with some credit. &nbsp;Then she set him and the
little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so awkward at this
service that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher knife to
grind. </p>

<p>
Afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he
had laid the good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the
present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read
picturesquely in story-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to
resign. &nbsp;And when, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a
basket of kittens to drown, he did resign. &nbsp;At least he was just going to
resign&mdash;for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and it seemed
to him that to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right thing&mdash;when
there was an interruption. &nbsp;The interruption was John Canty&mdash;with a
peddler's pack on his back&mdash;and Hugo.</p>

<p>The King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they
had had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about drawing the line,
but took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way,
without a word. &nbsp;He left the creatures in an out-house, and hurried on,
into a narrow lane at the rear.</p>

<p>Chapter XX. The Prince and the hermit.</p>

<p>The high hedge hid him from the house, now; and so, under the impulse of
a deadly fright, he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the
distance. &nbsp;He never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter of
the forest; then he turned and descried two figures in the distance.
That was sufficient; he did not wait to scan them critically, but hurried
on, and never abated his pace till he was far within the twilight depths
of the wood. Then he stopped; being persuaded that he was now tolerably
safe. He listened intently, but the stillness was profound and
solemn&mdash;awful, even, and depressing to the spirits. &nbsp;At wide intervals his
straining ear did detect sounds, but they were so remote, and hollow, and
mysterious, that they seemed not to be real sounds, but only the moaning
and complaining ghosts of departed ones. &nbsp;So the sounds were yet more
dreary than the silence which they interrupted.</p>

<p>It was his purpose, in the beginning, to stay where he was the rest of
the day; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body, and he was at last
obliged to resume movement in order to get warm. He struck straight
through the forest, hoping to pierce to a road presently, but he was
disappointed in this. &nbsp;He travelled on and on; but the farther he went,
the denser the wood became, apparently. &nbsp;The gloom began to thicken,
by-and-by, and the King realised that the night was coming on. &nbsp;It made him
shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place; so he tried to
hurry faster, but he only made the less speed, for he could not now see
well enough to choose his steps judiciously; consequently he kept
tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers.</p>

<p>And how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light! He
approached it warily, stopping often to look about him and listen. &nbsp;It
came from an unglazed window-opening in a shabby little hut. &nbsp;He heard a
voice, now, and felt a disposition to run and hide; but he changed his
mind at once, for this voice was praying, evidently. &nbsp;He glided to the
one window of the hut, raised himself on tiptoe, and stole a glance
within. &nbsp;The room was small; its floor was the natural earth, beaten hard
by use; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or two; near
it was a pail, a cup, a basin, and two or three pots and pans; there was
a short bench and a three-legged stool; on the hearth the remains of a
faggot fire were smouldering; before a shrine, which was lighted by a
single candle, knelt an aged man, and on an old wooden box at his side
lay an open book and a human skull. &nbsp;The man was of large, bony frame;
his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white; he was clothed in a
robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his heels.</p>

<br><br><br><br>


<p>"A holy hermit!" said the King to himself; "now am I indeed fortunate."</p>

<p>The hermit rose from his knees; the King knocked. &nbsp;A deep voice
responded&mdash;</p>

<p>"Enter!&mdash;but leave sin behind, for the ground whereon thou shalt stand is
holy!"</p>

<p>The King entered, and paused. &nbsp;The hermit turned a pair of gleaming,
unrestful eyes upon him, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who art thou?"</p>

<p>"I am the King," came the answer, with placid simplicity.</p>

<p>"Welcome, King!" cried the hermit, with enthusiasm. &nbsp;Then, bustling about
with feverish activity, and constantly saying, "Welcome, welcome," he
arranged his bench, seated the King on it, by the hearth, threw some
faggots on the fire, and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous
stride.</p>

<p>"Welcome! &nbsp;Many have sought sanctuary here, but they were not worthy, and
were turned away. &nbsp;But a King who casts his crown away, and despises the
vain splendours of his office, and clothes his body in rags, to devote
his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh&mdash;he is worthy, he
is welcome!&mdash;here shall he abide all his days till death come." &nbsp;The King
hastened to interrupt and explain, but the hermit paid no attention to
him&mdash;did not even hear him, apparently, but went right on with his talk,
with a raised voice and a growing energy. &nbsp;"And thou shalt be at peace
here. &nbsp;None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee with supplications
to return to that empty and foolish life which God hath moved thee to
abandon. &nbsp;Thou shalt pray here; thou shalt study the Book; thou shalt
meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world, and upon the
sublimities of the world to come; thou shalt feed upon crusts and herbs,
and scourge thy body with whips, daily, to the purifying of thy soul.
Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin; thou shalt drink water only;
and thou shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at peace; for whoso comes to seek
thee shall go his way again, baffled; he shall not find thee, he shall
not molest thee."</p>

<p>The old man, still pacing back and forth, ceased to speak aloud, and
began to mutter. &nbsp;The King seized this opportunity to state his case; and
he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension. &nbsp;But
the hermit went on muttering, and gave no heed. &nbsp;And still muttering, he
approached the King and said impressively&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Sh! &nbsp;I will tell you a secret!" &nbsp;He bent down to impart it, but checked
himself, and assumed a listening attitude. &nbsp;After a moment or two he went
on tiptoe to the window-opening, put his head out, and peered around in
the gloaming, then came tiptoeing back again, put his face close down to
the King's, and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am an archangel!"</p>


<br><br>
<a name="20-251"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="20-251.jpg (65K)" src="images/20-251.jpg" height="645" width="331">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>The King started violently, and said to himself, "Would God I were with
the outlaws again; for lo, now am I the prisoner of a madman!" &nbsp;His
apprehensions were heightened, and they showed plainly in his face. &nbsp;In a
low excited voice the hermit continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see you feel my atmosphere! &nbsp;There's awe in your face! &nbsp;None may be in
this atmosphere and not be thus affected; for it is the very atmosphere
of heaven. &nbsp;I go thither and return, in the twinkling of an eye. &nbsp;I was
made an archangel on this very spot, it is five years ago, by angels sent
from heaven to confer that awful dignity. &nbsp;Their presence filled this
place with an intolerable brightness. &nbsp;And they knelt to me, King! yes,
they knelt to me! for I was greater than they. &nbsp;I have walked in the
courts of heaven, and held speech with the patriarchs. &nbsp;Touch my hand&mdash;be
not afraid&mdash;touch it. &nbsp;There&mdash;now thou hast touched a hand which has been
clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob! &nbsp;For I have walked in the golden
courts; I have seen the Deity face to face!" &nbsp;He paused, to give this
speech effect; then his face suddenly changed, and he started to his feet
again saying, with angry energy, "Yes, I am an archangel; A MERE
ARCHANGEL!&mdash;I that might have been pope! &nbsp;It is verily true. &nbsp;I was told
it from heaven in a dream, twenty years ago; ah, yes, I was to be
pope!&mdash;and I SHOULD have been pope, for Heaven had said it&mdash;but the King
dissolved my religious house, and I, poor obscure unfriended monk, was
cast homeless upon the world, robbed of my mighty destiny!" Here he began
to mumble again, and beat his forehead in futile rage, with his fist; now
and then articulating a venomous curse, and now and then a pathetic
"Wherefore I am nought but an archangel&mdash;I that should have been pope!"</p>

<p>So he went on, for an hour, whilst the poor little King sat and suffered.
Then all at once the old man's frenzy departed, and he became all
gentleness. &nbsp;His voice softened, he came down out of his clouds, and fell
to prattling along so simply and so humanly, that he soon won the King's
heart completely. &nbsp;The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the fire and
made him comfortable; doctored his small bruises and abrasions with a
deft and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a
supper&mdash;chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking the lad's
cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way that in a
little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were
changed to reverence and affection for the man.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>This happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper; then,
after a prayer before the shrine, the hermit put the boy to bed, in a
small adjoining room, tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother
might; and so, with a parting caress, left him and sat down by the fire,
and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way.
Presently he paused; then tapped his forehead several times with his
fingers, as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his
mind. &nbsp;Apparently he was unsuccessful. &nbsp;Now he started quickly up, and
entered his guest's room, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou art King?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the response, drowsily uttered.</p>

<p>"What King?"</p>

<p>"Of England."</p>

<p>"Of England? &nbsp;Then Henry is gone!"</p>

<p>"Alack, it is so. &nbsp;I am his son."</p>

<p>A black frown settled down upon the hermit's face, and he clenched his
bony hands with a vindictive energy. &nbsp;He stood a few moments, breathing
fast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in a husky voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and
homeless?"</p>

<p>There was no response. &nbsp;The old man bent down and scanned the boy's
reposeful face and listened to his placid breathing. &nbsp;"He sleeps&mdash;sleeps
soundly;" and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of
evil satisfaction. &nbsp;A smile flitted across the dreaming boy's features.
The hermit muttered, "So&mdash;his heart is happy;" and he turned away. &nbsp;He
went stealthily about the place, seeking here and there for something;
now and then halting to listen, now and then jerking his head around and
casting a quick glance toward the bed; and always muttering, always
mumbling to himself. &nbsp;At last he found what he seemed to want&mdash;a rusty
old butcher knife and a whetstone. &nbsp;Then he crept to his place by the
fire, sat himself down, and began to whet the knife softly on the stone,
still muttering, mumbling, ejaculating. &nbsp;The winds sighed around the
lonely place, the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the
distances. &nbsp;The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at
the old man from cracks and coverts, but he went on with his work, rapt,
absorbed, and noted none of these things.</p>

<p>At long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife, and
nodded his head with satisfaction. &nbsp;"It grows sharper," he said; "yes, it
grows sharper."</p>

<p>He took no note of the flight of time, but worked tranquilly on,
entertaining himself with his thoughts, which broke out occasionally in
articulate speech&mdash;</p>

<p>"His father wrought us evil, he destroyed us&mdash;and is gone down into the
eternal fires! &nbsp;Yes, down into the eternal fires! &nbsp;He escaped us&mdash;but it
was God's will, yes it was God's will, we must not repine. &nbsp;But he hath
not escaped the fires! &nbsp;No, he hath not escaped the fires, the consuming,
unpitying, remorseless fires&mdash;and THEY are everlasting!"</p>

<p>And so he wrought, and still wrought&mdash;mumbling, chuckling a low rasping
chuckle at times&mdash;and at times breaking again into words&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was his father that did it all. &nbsp;I am but an archangel; but for him I
should be pope!"</p>

<br><br><br><br>


<p>The King stirred. &nbsp;The hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside, and went
down upon his knees, bending over the prostrate form with his knife
uplifted. &nbsp;The boy stirred again; his eyes came open for an instant, but
there was no speculation in them, they saw nothing; the next moment his
tranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more.</p>

<p>The hermit watched and listened, for a time, keeping his position and
scarcely breathing; then he slowly lowered his arms, and presently crept
away, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is long past midnight; it is not best that he should cry out, lest by
accident someone be passing."</p>

<p>He glided about his hovel, gathering a rag here, a thong there, and
another one yonder; then he returned, and by careful and gentle handling
he managed to tie the King's ankles together without waking him. &nbsp;Next he
essayed to tie the wrists; he made several attempts to cross them, but
the boy always drew one hand or the other away, just as the cord was
ready to be applied; but at last, when the archangel was almost ready to
despair, the boy crossed his hands himself, and the next moment they were
bound. Now a bandage was passed under the sleeper's chin and brought up
over his head and tied fast&mdash;and so softly, so gradually, and so deftly
were the knots drawn together and compacted, that the boy slept
peacefully through it all without stirring.</p>

<p>Chapter XXI. Hendon to the rescue.</p>

<p>The old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and brought the
low bench. &nbsp;He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and
flickering light, and the other half in shadow; and so, with his craving
eyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there,
heedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled
and chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as
a grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay
bound and helpless in his web.</p>

<p>After a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,&mdash;yet not seeing,
his mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction,&mdash;observed, on a
sudden, that the boy's eyes were open! wide open and staring!&mdash;staring up
in frozen horror at the knife. &nbsp;The smile of a gratified devil crept over
the old man's face, and he said, without changing his attitude or his
occupation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Son of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?"</p>

<p>The boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time forced a
smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit chose to
interpret as an affirmative answer to his question.</p>

<p>"Then pray again. &nbsp;Pray the prayer for the dying!"</p>

<p>A shudder shook the boy's frame, and his face blenched. &nbsp;Then he
struggled again to free himself&mdash;turning and twisting himself this way
and that; tugging frantically, fiercely, desperately&mdash;but uselessly&mdash;to
burst his fetters; and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him,
and nodded his head, and placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time
to time, "The moments are precious, they are few and precious&mdash;pray the
prayer for the dying!"</p>

<p>The boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his struggles,
panting. &nbsp;The tears came, then, and trickled, one after the other, down
his face; but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the
savage old man.</p>

<p>The dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up sharply,
with a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I may not indulge this ecstasy longer! &nbsp;The night is already gone. &nbsp;It
seems but a moment&mdash;only a moment; would it had endured a year! &nbsp;Seed of
the Church's spoiler, close thy perishing eyes, an' thou fearest to look
upon&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings. &nbsp;The old man sank upon his
knees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over the moaning boy.</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Hark! &nbsp;There was a sound of voices near the cabin&mdash;the knife dropped from
the hermit's hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up,
trembling. &nbsp;The sounds increased, and presently the voices became rough
and angry; then came blows, and cries for help; then a clatter of swift
footsteps, retreating. &nbsp;Immediately came a succession of thundering
knocks upon the cabin door, followed by&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hullo-o-o! &nbsp;Open! &nbsp;And despatch, in the name of all the devils!"</p>

<p>Oh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the King's
ears; for it was Miles Hendon's voice!</p>

<p>The hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly out of the
bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway the King heard a
talk, to this effect, proceeding from the 'chapel':&mdash;</p>

<p>"Homage and greeting, reverend sir! &nbsp;Where is the boy&mdash;MY boy?"</p>

<p>"What boy, friend?"</p>

<p>"What boy! &nbsp;Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!&mdash;I am not
in the humour for it. &nbsp;Near to this place I caught the scoundrels who I
judged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; they said he was
at large again, and they had tracked him to your door. &nbsp;They showed me
his very footprints. &nbsp;Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an'
thou produce him not&mdash;Where is the boy?"</p>

<p>"O good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried
here the night. &nbsp;If such as you take an interest in such as he, know,
then, that I have sent him of an errand. &nbsp;He will be back anon."</p>

<p>"How soon? &nbsp;How soon? &nbsp;Come, waste not the time&mdash;cannot I overtake him?
How soon will he be back?"</p>

<p>"Thou need'st not stir; he will return quickly."</p>

<p>"So be it, then. &nbsp;I will try to wait. &nbsp;But stop!&mdash;YOU sent him of an
errand?&mdash;you! &nbsp;Verily this is a lie&mdash;he would not go. &nbsp;He would pull thy
old beard, an' thou didst offer him such an insolence. Thou hast lied,
friend; thou hast surely lied! &nbsp;He would not go for thee, nor for any
man."</p>

<p>"For any MAN&mdash;no; haply not. &nbsp;But I am not a man."</p>

<p>"WHAT! &nbsp;Now o' God's name what art thou, then?"</p>

<p>"It is a secret&mdash;mark thou reveal it not. &nbsp;I am an archangel!"</p>

<p>There was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon&mdash;not altogether
unprofane&mdash;followed by&mdash;</p>

<p>"This doth well and truly account for his complaisance! &nbsp;Right well I
knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any
mortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when an archangel gives the word
o' command! &nbsp;Let me&mdash;'sh! &nbsp;What noise was that?"</p>

<p>All this while the little King had been yonder, alternately quaking with
terror and trembling with hope; and all the while, too, he had thrown all
the strength he could into his anguished moanings, constantly expecting
them to reach Hendon's ear, but always realising, with bitterness, that
they failed, or at least made no impression. &nbsp;So this last remark of his
servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh fields to the dying;
and he exerted himself once more, and with all his energy, just as the
hermit was saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Noise? &nbsp;I heard only the wind."</p>

<p>"Mayhap it was. &nbsp;Yes, doubtless that was it. &nbsp;I have been hearing it
faintly all the&mdash;there it is again! &nbsp;It is not the wind! &nbsp;What an odd
sound! &nbsp;Come, we will hunt it out!"</p>

<p>Now the King's joy was nearly insupportable. &nbsp;His tired lungs did their
utmost&mdash;and hopefully, too&mdash;but the sealed jaws and the muffling
sheepskin sadly crippled the effort. &nbsp;Then the poor fellow's heart sank,
to hear the hermit say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, it came from without&mdash;I think from the copse yonder. &nbsp;Come, I will
lead the way."</p>

<p>The King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps die
quickly away&mdash;then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful silence.</p>

<p>It seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching
again&mdash;and this time he heard an added sound,&mdash;the trampling of hoofs,
apparently. &nbsp;Then he heard Hendon say&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will not wait longer. &nbsp;I CANNOT wait longer. &nbsp;He has lost his way in
this thick wood. &nbsp;Which direction took he? &nbsp;Quick&mdash;point it out to me."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;but wait; I will go with thee."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;good! &nbsp;Why, truly thou art better than thy looks. &nbsp;Marry I do not
think there's not another archangel with so right a heart as thine. &nbsp;Wilt
ride? &nbsp;Wilt take the wee donkey that's for my boy, or wilt thou fork thy
holy legs over this ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have provided
for myself?&mdash;and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the indifferent
sum of a month's usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker out of work."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own feet, and
will walk."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="21-262"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="21-262.jpg (97K)" src="images/21-262.jpg" height="562" width="728">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Then prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life in my
hands and make what success I may toward mounting the big one."</p>

<p>Then followed a confusion of kicks, cuffs, tramplings and plungings,
accompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses, and finally
a bitter apostrophe to the mule, which must have broken its spirit, for
hostilities seemed to cease from that moment.</p>

<p>With unutterable misery the fettered little King heard the voices and
footsteps fade away and die out. &nbsp;All hope forsook him, now, for the
moment, and a dull despair settled down upon his heart. "My only friend
is deceived and got rid of," he said; "the hermit will return and&mdash;" &nbsp;He
finished with a gasp; and at once fell to struggling so frantically with
his bonds again, that he shook off the smothering sheepskin.</p>

<p>And now he heard the door open! &nbsp;The sound chilled him to the
marrow&mdash;already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat. &nbsp;Horror made him close
his eyes; horror made him open them again&mdash;and before him stood John
Canty and Hugo!</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>He would have said "Thank God!" if his jaws had been free.</p>

<p>A moment or two later his limbs were at liberty, and his captors, each
gripping him by an arm, were hurrying him with all speed through the
forest.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
